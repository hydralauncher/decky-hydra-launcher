# Hydra Launcher Plugin for Decky Loader

**Hydra Launcher Plugin** is an official Decky Loader extension that brings the power of Hydra directly into Steam Deck’s Game Mode. With it, you can log in to your Hydra account, track playtime for both Steam and non-Steam games, and manage cloud backups — all from the comfort of the Decky sidebar.

## 🚀 Installation

### Developer Mode (Temporary)

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in Decky Loader.
2. Click "Install Plugin via URL".
3. Paste: `https://hydra.la/decky`

> ⚠️ The plugin will be available on the Decky Store soon!
